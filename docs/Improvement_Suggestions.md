Suggestions for Improvement:



1. Integrate End-to-End Automated Regression Tests: Expand Playwright test coverage for all critical search flows (including filters, sorting, edge cases, and no-results scenarios) and run these tests on every code commit using CI/CD pipelines for feedback.



2\. Implement Real-Time Search Analytics \& Monitoring: Set up dashboards and automated alerts using tools like Google Analytics to monitor search result quality, error rates.



3\. Establish a Regular Data Integrity Review Process: Schedule weekly SQL audits and sanity checks on production data (e.g., any missing fields) and enforce data validation at both input and backend layers to prevent bad listings leaking into search results.
